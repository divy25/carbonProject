## Deployment 
   In this project we were able to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website. But it is very large website , so in the given time constraints it was not possible to clone all the webpages . We tried our best to clone the maximum pages as we can. Finally we were achieved our target to clone the main important functionality pages of the website. As we do not want to overwhelm you with the snapshots, we haven't shared all the pages here. Please fork the repository and then use it on your own.
